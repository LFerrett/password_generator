# Password Generator

## Description

The goal of this project was to modify existing code to create a working password generator using HTML and JavaScript. The password generator should generate a password upon clicking the button on the website, prompting the user for criteria, including length and what characters to use in the final password. The generated password should then be displayed in an alert or written to the page.
